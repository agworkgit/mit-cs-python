# In Python, a variable is just a name, nothing more. Remember this—it is im-
# portant. An assignment statement associates the name to the left of the = symbol
# with the object denoted by the expression to the right of the =
# . Remember this
# too. An object can have one, more than one, or no name associated with it.
